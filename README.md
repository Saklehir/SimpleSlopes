# SimpleSlopes Package
This package is created based on suggestions by Dawson & Richter (2006) for three way interactions. 
It is useful for plotting, checking the significance of slopes from zero, and checking the differences among slopes. 

# How to Install on Your Local Device:
Step 1: install devtools if you dont have it on your devide

`if (!require(devtools)) install.packages('devtools')`

Step 2: 

`install_github("Saklehir/SimpleSlopes")`

# How to Use the Package
Step 1: Load the package
library(SimpleSlopes)

Step 2: Create an `lm` object with three way interactions (continous variables)
Using the airquality dataset in R, we are going to predict `Ozone` by three way interaction of solar radiation (`Solar.R`), wind (`Wind`) and temperature (`Temp`)
When you build your model, please make sure that predictor comes first, first moderator second and second moderator third in order. You will have to be consistent in entering the moderator variables in that order in the following functions as well.

`lm.model <- lm(Ozone ~ Solar.R + Solar.R:Wind + Solar.R:Temp + Wind:Temp + Solar.R:Wind:Temp, data = airquality)`

Step 3: Plot the simple slopes (scores are based on 1 SD higher and lower than the mean for moderator):

`slopePlot(model=lm.model, xvar = 'Solar.R', modvars = c('Wind', 'Temp'), modNames = c('Wind', 'Temperature'), x.lab = 'Solar Radiation', y.lab = 'Ozone Level')`

Here `modNames` refers to the moderator names you want to appear in figure legend. Instead of using the ones in the dataset, you can specify the moderating variable names for publishability purposes. `x.lab` and `y.lab` refer to the predictor and outcome variables respectively. Just like moderators, you can specify predictor and outcome variables to be used in the figure.
 
Step 4: Check if simple slopes are significantly different than zero:

`slopeTest(model=lm.model, xvar = 'Solar.R', modvars = c('Wind', 'Temp'))`

Step 5: Check if the slopes are significantly different than each other (pairwise slope differences):

`slopeDifference(model=lm.model, xvar = 'Solar.R', modvars = c('Wind', 'Temp'))`
