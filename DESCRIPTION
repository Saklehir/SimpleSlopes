Version: 0.1.0
Author: Cafer Bakac
Maintainer: Cafer Bakac <cafer.bakac@tum.de>
Description: This package passes 'lm' objects and 1) plots three way interactions in a publishable format
    2) checks if simple slopes are different from zero, and
    3) computes slope differences. All fo these are computed following recommendations by Dawson & Richter (2006).
